Circuits Documentation:
=======================

Circuits is an event-driven framework with a focus on Component Software
Architectures where System Functionality is defined in Components. Components
communicate with one another by propagating events throughout the system. Each
Component can react to events and expose events to other parts of the system
Components are able to manage their own events and can also be linked to other
Components.

Circuits has a clean architecture and has no external dependencies on any
other library. It's simplistic design is unmatchable but yet delivers a
powerful framework for building large, scalable, maintainable applications
and systems. Circuits was a core integral part of the
[http://trac.softcircuit.com.au/pymills pymills] library developed in 2006
and was partly inspired by the [http://trac.edgewall.org Trac] architecture.
