[[TOC]]

Circuits can by installed in any number of ways, using setuptools' easy_install
from source or using a binary installer. It's highly recommended you try to
install circuits using setuptools or from source.

== Setuptools ==

To instlal Circuits using setuptools' easy_install:

{{{
#!sh
$ easy_install circuits
}}}

== Source ==

To install CIrcuits from source:

Download Circuits from
 * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/circuits/> Python Package Index]
 * [http://trac.softcircuit.com.au/circuits/downloads> CIrcuits Website]

Extract archive and Install:

{{{
#!sh
$ tar zxvf circuits--xxx.tar.gz
$ python setup.py install
}}}

=== Installing System Wide ===

The insturctions in the previous section describe how to install circuits in
this way. If you want to change the location, use the {{{prefix}}} option.

=== Installing into your Home Directory ===

To install circuits in your home directory, use the {{{-home=/path/to/home}}}
option to {{{setup.py}}}. Example:

{{{
#!sh
$ python setup.py install --home=$HOME
}}}

=== Installing in Development mode ===

To install circuits in development mode, use the {{{develop}}} command
instead of {{{install}}} This allows you to easily update/upgrade circuits
and not have to worry about re-installing.

== Prerequisites ==

* Python 2.5 or greater (''Also works with Python-3.x``)

=== Setting up setuptools: ===
On Windows: 

download http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py and then run it from 
the command line.

On UNIX: 

If you have curl or  wget installed you can do this with a single command: 

{{{
#!/sh
$ curl http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py | sudo python
}}}

== Validate the installation: ==

To check if you installed circuits, type:

{{{
#!sh
$ python -c "import circuits"
}}}

If everything worked, nothing should be displayed.

Also tryr and run the [source:examples/hello.py Hello World Example]:

{{{
#!sh
cd examples
python hello.py
}}}

You should get the following output:

{{{
~/circuits/examples
$ python hello.py 
Hello World
}}}
