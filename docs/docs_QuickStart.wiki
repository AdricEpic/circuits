== Getting Started ==
Now that you've got Circuits installed, what now ?

The very first thing you'll need to do is import parts of the circuits library:
{{{
#!python
from circuits import listener, Event, Component, Manager
}}}

== The Pattern ==

A recommended pattern for circuits based systems/application is as follows:

{{{
#!python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from traceback import format_exc

from circuits import listener, Event, Component, Manager

class Foo(Event):
   "Foo Event"

class Bar(Event):
   "Bar Event"

class FooBar(Component):

   @listener("foo")
   def onFOO(self):
      print "foo"

   @listener("bar")
   def onBAR(self):
      print "bar"

def main():
   manager = Manager()

   foobar = FooBar()

   manager += foobar

   manager.push(Foo(), "foo")
   manager.push(Bar(), "bar")

   while True:
      try:
         manager.flush()
      except KeyboardInterrupt:
         break
      except Exception, error:
         print "ERROR: %s" % error
         print format_exc()

if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()
}}}
