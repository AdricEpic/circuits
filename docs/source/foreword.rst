circuits was a reincarnation of a design architecture that the author had been
working on since mid-2005. It was then part of the pymills project
(*named so after the author*) and was just a single module, pymills.event

It was an architecture inspired from learning Behavior Trees while studying
Software Engineering at Griffith University (*in Queensland of Australia*)
and quickly grew into a useful and successful framework to build more
complex systems and applications with.

circuits became what it is today by the encourement of a co-worker of a
startup company at the time and was rebranded into it's own proejct.
