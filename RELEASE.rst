-------------------------------------


Python 3 Support
................

This is the third attempt at getting Python 3 support for circuits working
while still maintaining Python 2 compatibility. These release finally adds
full support for Python 3 as well as maintaining compatibility with Python
2.6 and 2.7 with the same codebase.

.. note::
   Python 2.5 support has been dropped as of this release and will no
   longer be supported in future. There may be a maintenance branch
   specifically for Python 2.5 if required.


Code Coverage

circuits now has 80% test coverage on all supported versions of Python
including Python 2.6, Python 2.7 and Python 3.2
